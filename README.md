            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am serving as a Clinical Psychologist in the public health sector at Yahia Fares University Campus named Chouai Ben Aissa in Medea Algeria, a position I achieved through a competitive national exam where I had the highest score, placing me as the top candidate. Since joining in March 2022, I have demonstrated my dedication to the field and my ability to excel in challenging environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my role at Yahia Fares University, I am currently contributing my expertise as a Clinical Psychologist specialized in learning difficulties at Happiness Clinic in Medea Algeria. My previous experience includes working in an autism unit at the Care Unit in the Local Public Health Establishment of Medea on 2020. These roles have equipped me with a comprehensive skill set, enabling me to address a wide range of mental health concerns with empathy and professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my academic journey, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Clinical Psychology from Yahia Fares University and subsequently pursued a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology from the same institution. As a student leader, I served as the Vice President of the Psychology Students of Medea Club, where I actively participated in organizing events to promote psychological awareness and foster a supportive community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional journey has been further enriched by apprenticeships in various units since 2019, such as the Regional Social Medical Center for Firefighters Gherbi Mohamed in Medea Algeria, where I navigated challenging and diverse cases, contributing to my adaptability and resilience as a clinical psychologist.
